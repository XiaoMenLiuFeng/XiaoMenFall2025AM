                <section>
                    <h3>Introduction </h3>
                    <p>Hydnellum regium is a tooth fungus in the family Bankeraceae. Found in western North America, it
                        was described as new to science in 1964 by Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison, who reported
                        collections from Oregon, Idaho, and Colorado. It fruits singly or in groups under pine and
                        spruce trees. Its purple-black fruitbodies are large, forming complex rosettes measuring up 25
                        cm (10 in) wide by 15 cm (6 in) tall. The spore print is brown. Its spores are roughly
                        spherical, tuberculate (covered with rounded bumps), and measure 4.5-6 by 3.5-4.5 Î¼m. </p>

                    <h3>Deying Properties</h3>
                    <p>I love tooth fungus! The colors they yield are my kind of colors. They are beautiful and complex
                        to work with in the dye pot. They love an alkaline bath and like to have their pH shifted within
                        the first 5-10 minutes of working them. I used sodium carbonate (soda ash) to shift my dye baths
                        to pH 9. There is a long tradition of using ammonia with tooth fungus and I might try a test to
                        compare the results on fiber. You have to be sure to maintain the dye bath at pH 9 throughout
                        the duration of the dye bath.
                        <br>
                        Cellulose fibers love high alkaline environments so they respond
                        very well to the dye from tooth fungus. Don't worry if your fibers look like they have a brown
                        tinge on them in the dye bath as all tooth fungus do this and the brown washes out. If you
                        aren't happy with the results of your color you can also dip your fibers in an alkaline after
                        bath to shift the colors. I have never been successful at getting a clear lake from any of the
                        Hydnellums. Pigment settles to the bottom but the liquid is incredibly dark and filled with
                        color. I save this filtered liquid, evaporate it down and use it for ink. It works beautifully.

                    <h3>Personal Experience</h3>
                    <p>When my local Mount Adams Institute (MAI) sent out their newsletter of events and I saw Michael
                        Beug was hosting a lecture and foray I had to double check what I had just read. I immediately
                        texted my friends, one being Rachel Zoller, and said we had to go. I was new to the area and had
                        heard a famous mycologist lived in our community but I had yet to substantiate the 'rumor' or
                        figure out who it was. Reading this newsletter I automatically knew, it was Michael Beug! We all
                        signed up and had a magical day with Michael in the forest and I learned so much from his
                        lecture.

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Michael was with the North American Key Council on a retreat that weekend and said he had just been
                talking to Steve Trudell and Joe Ammirati who wrote the book Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest and they
                told him that H. regium did not grow in our area. Michael was astonished. Here it was. And not only here
                it was there were tons of patches and huge clusters of them everywhere. We started doing the happy myco
                dance plucking them up. We had bags upon bags. We enlisted others on the foray to help carry them. I
                have no idea how many pounds we found. Michael took a huge bag up to our friend Alissa Allen when they
                met up at the Brightenbush foray a few weeks later. I still have bags of H. regium all these years later
                and am so thankful Michael was there to identify this magical dye mushroom for me.

            <h2>A Memorable Mushroom Encounter</h2>
            <p>He told me that every other year he volunteers his time to MAI to do this as a fundraiser for
                scholarships. That was inspirational in and of it itself. I continued to join every other year and went
                out with Michael in 2019, the year we had an epic mushroom bloom in the Pacific Northwest. I was walking
                around and came across a Hydnellum. I couldn't immediately identify it, so I consulted my book Mushrooms
                of the Pacific Northwest and couldn't find it. I had never seen one like it before. I asked Michael when
                he had a moment if he could come help me identify it. He was at least 15' away and blurted out 'that is
                Hydnellum regium!'' and was very excited. I too got excited having never seen one before but had heard
                of the famed mushroom dye. </p>
