      <h2>The Psychological Boost</h2>
      <p>"Desserts have an unparalleled ability to lift our spirits. The simple act of enjoying a delicious
        dessert triggers the release of endorphins, the body's natural "feel-good" hormones. This
        chemical reaction can instantly improve mood and reduce stress. Treating yourself to a dessert
        after a long day or celebrating a small victory can provide a much-needed psychological boost,
        making you feel happier and more content."</p><br>

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>The term "dessert" originated from the French word desservir, meaning "to clear the table", and
        it referred to the final course of the meal, presented after the table was "cleared" (deservi).
        <br>
        "One of the earliest uses of the term in a culinary context is in the Ménagier de Paris (1393),
        which includes a course of "desserte" in three of the menus, one of which includes sweet
        pastries and fruits, another of which includes savory frumenty and venison.""
        <br>
        "In later centuries, the term continued to refer to the last course of the meal. In the late 19th
        century, the word "desserts" also came to refer to the dishes served in the dessert course."

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>"Sweets were fed to the gods in ancient Mesopotamia and ancient India and other ancient
        civilizations. Herodotus mentions that Persian meals featured many desserts, and were more
        varied in their sweet offerings than the main dishes. German army officer Helmuth von Moltke
        whilst serving in the Ottoman Empire noted the unusual presentation of courses with the sweet
        courses served between roasts and other savory dishes."</p><br>
