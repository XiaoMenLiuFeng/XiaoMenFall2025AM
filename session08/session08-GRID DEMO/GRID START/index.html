			<h2>Color & Mood</h2>
			<p>Do you feel energized when you see red? Does the color blue make you feel calm and relaxed? Artists and
				interior designers have long believed that color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions.
				"Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions," the artist Pablo Picasso once remarked.
				<br>

				Color is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even
				influence physiological reactions. Certain colors have been associated with physiological changes,
				including increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain.
			</p>
			<p>Colors in the red area of the color spectrum are known as warm colors and include red, orange, and
				yellow. These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of
				anger and hostility.
				<br>
				Colors on the blue side of the spectrum are known as cool colors and include blue, purple, and green.
				These colors are often described as calm, but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference.
			</p>
			<p>Red: Passion, excitement, love
				<br>
				Pink: Soft, reserved, earthy
